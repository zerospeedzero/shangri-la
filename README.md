Case Study: Shangri-La Resort WordPress Theme
=============================================

Overview
--------

The objective of this case study was to create a customized WordPress theme for the Shangri-La resort, enhancing its visual appeal and modernizing its web interface while maintaining the existing layout and data of the website.

Inspirations and Research
-------------------------

To achieve the project's goals, a thorough analysis was conducted by visiting the official website of Shangri-La. This involved studying the colour theory, tuning, and underlying technology utilized on the website. Additionally, a focus was placed on understanding the business value delivered to potential customers through the web interface.

Role
----

The project was led and executed by me with skills in graphic design and web development. The primary responsibility was the development of the WordPress theme module.

Planning Milestones
-------------------

*   Definition of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and mission-critical success factors to guide project evaluation.
*   Development of a comprehensive project task plan, including estimates for task completion durations.
*   Identification of the project's critical path to prioritize essential elements.
*   Researching the process of building WordPress theme modules.
*   Designing the new web layout to ensure a visually appealing interface.
*   Implementing coding and graphic design elements in accordance with the new theme.
*   Conducting thorough function tests and peer reviews to ensure quality and reliability.
*   Project kick-off and final submission of the completed WordPress theme.

Two Draft Versions of the Web Layout with Colour Combination
------------------------------------------------------------

Initial draft versions of the web layout were developed, showcasing the proposed colour combinations and design elements.

Final Version
-------------

The final version of the WordPress theme closely resembled the official Shangri-La resort hotel website, with similar color schemes and web layouts.

Pain Points / Challenges
------------------------

*   Restriction on modifying existing data and data relationships, necessitating the retention and seamless migration of existing authors and their posts to the new modern solution.
*   Non-containerized web element data provided by WordPress, such as headings, images, and paragraphs for posts, requiring meticulous styling to address the lack of HTML element grouping.
*   Limited functionality with only theming modules, resulting in partial web page reloads during page switching, which negatively impacted user experience when compared to modern JavaScript frameworks.

Call-to-Action
--------------

Despite the aforementioned constraints, the project successfully addressed these challenges, and the required WordPress theme modules were developed, significantly enhancing the overall modernity of the original website.
